# Indian Markets

This section documents what is true of the Indian market and false of
every other market. Everything here lives in the `honba-india` crate,
which depends only on `honba-entities` — meaning it can be tested
without an engine.

## The Documents

- **[Market Calendar](market_calendar.md)** — trading hours, holidays,
  Muhurat sessions, and the distinction between trading holidays and
  settlement holidays.
- **[Cost Model](cost_model.md)** — STT, exchange fees, SEBI turnover
  fee, stamp duty, GST, and brokerage. The single most consequential
  set of assumptions in a backtest.
- **[Universes](universes.md)** — NIFTY 50, BANK NIFTY, and the Alpha
  30 family. How constituents are selected, when they rebalance, and
  how to avoid look-ahead bias.
- **[Mutual Funds](mutual_funds.md)** — AMFI NAV data, TER, SIP
  backtesting, and the direct-vs-regular plan distinction.
- **[Options](options.md)** — weekly and monthly expiry cycles, strike
  intervals, Greeks, and the STT asymmetry between premium and
  exercise.
- **[Brokers](brokers.md)** — practical differences between the eight
  supported broker adapters.

## The Two Facts That Change Everything

Most strategies that fail in Indian markets fail because of one of
these:

1. **Costs are large.** A delivery equity round-trip costs roughly
   0.14% per side once STT, exchange fees, stamp duty, GST, and
   brokerage are summed. A strategy trading weekly needs a substantial
   gross edge just to break even.
2. **The calendar is not simple.** Pre-open sessions, Muhurat trading,
   and settlement-vs-trading holiday distinctions all affect when
   orders execute and when funds settle.

The [Cost Model](cost_model.md) and [Market Calendar](market_calendar.md)
documents are the two most important in this section.
